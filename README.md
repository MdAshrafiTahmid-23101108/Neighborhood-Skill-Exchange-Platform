# Neighborhood Skill Exchange Platform
**Description:** A platform that enables community members to exchange skills (e.g., teaching guitar, coding, or cooking) through a bartering system, fostering local learning and collaboration.

**Features:**

**1)Skill Listing and Search:** Users can list skills they offer or seek, with details like expertise level, availability, and preferred barter (e.g., trading a cooking lesson for a language lesson). The database stores skill profiles and search metadata.

**2)Barter Matching System:** The platform matches users based on complementary skill needs (e.g., a user offering yoga classes is matched with someone offering photography lessons).

**3)Scheduling Tool:** Users can propose and confirm time slots for skill exchange sessions, with calendar integration and reminders stored in the database.

**4)Feedback and Rating System:** After each exchange, users rate the quality of the session and reliability of the partner, building a trust-based reputation score.

**5)Unique Feature 1: Skill Tree Visualization:** The database tracks users’ skill acquisition history and generates an interactive “skill tree” visualization, showing their learning journey and suggesting new skills to explore based on their progress. 

**6)Unique Feature 2: Community Skill Challenges:** The platform hosts community-driven challenges (e.g., “Learn a new skill this month”) with leaderboards and rewards, stored in the database, encouraging collective participation and gamification.
